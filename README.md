These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine.

### Prerequisites

What things you need to install the software and how to install them on Mac OS X with Homebrew

```
$ brew install node
```

### Installing

A step by step series of examples that tell you how to get a development env running

Say what the step will be

```

End with an example of getting some data out of the system or using it for a little demo

```
const FakeBitTorrentClient = require('FakeBitTorrentClient');

const client = new FakeBitTorrentClient(trackerUrl, torrentHash, options);

const bytes = 1024 * 1024 * 32; // 32 MB

client
  .upload(bytes)
  .then(() => console.log(['Uploaded ', bytes, ' bytes to ', trackerUrl].join('')))
  .catch(err => console.error(['Error : ', err].join('')));
```
